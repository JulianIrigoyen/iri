    "TEMPLATE: Technically speaking, the XAU/USD maintains a bearish outlook for the short term, as per indicators on the daily chart.

If broken, the $1,915 area and psychological mark at $1,900 could come into play. Furthermore, a move above the 100-day SMA at $1,942 would suggest a continuation of the bullish trend for the yellow metal, with next resistances at the 20-day SMA at $1,953 and the $1,975 zone."
